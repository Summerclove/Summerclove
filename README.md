### Important, please read

I got tired of how toxic the JJBA area is so just like half of the people from the area, I'm migrating to spawn, and yes I am definitely aware of my Github page being stalked as well...
this area is where I met my friends and now shit have gotten worse so I've started to compile things as well.

To you, yes you who is stalking this page, I am linking both the suicide note my friend left for you:
https://rentry.org/funnyval (what's worse is no one is able to reach out to them, they disappeared without any warnings and it's been 2 months already, everyone is on edge and are
hoping/praying for them to come back and to answer/reply back to people's dms again, they haven't replied nor accepted people's friend requests since September and all of their friends
mental health had been dropping because of this situation alone, everyone had been begging for at least 1 sign of them being alright but some of our friends had already lost their hopes).

I'm also linking my other friend's rentry telling you to leave everyone's bios and githubs alone and to stop stalking
them: [https://rentry.co/johnnyjoestar_](https://rentry.co/johnnyjoestar_) (they only hopped on the game like this morning, literally this morning only
because they're avoiding the group after what happened to our friend, they had been begging for their group to stop in their profiles because they are aware that they're being stalked on as well
after finding out that this group's ring leader copy pasted their partner's DNI list and used it as a status in their Discord **DESPITE THEM BEING HIDDEN FOR THE TWO OF THEM, AND YES THEIR GROUP WAS REPORTED BEFORE TO THE PT MODS AND THEY TOOK ACTION**).

this entire thing has gotten too far with your group.

To those who are curious to see the rentry log I have, whisper me, because I have the dates of evidences for this shit
dating back from January up until recent as well, I won't hesitate to send the entire thing in Discord because I'm so 
fucking done, I am not happy, I am angry at you and your stupid ass group especially after one of my friend's lives got involved,
no I will not take this down, you need to learn to take fucking accountability for this, just be glad that I am not naming
you publicly here on this callout github profile (if people found out your name, it's probably because of the links, not that
I care because of what happened to one of my friends, this needs to be heard by people to bring this horrendous behavior to light).

Btw, if you got angry despite me not straight up naming you publicly, then you're 100% guilty of this, take accountability, AND DO NOT WEAPONIZE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH EXCUSE AGAIN
YOU HAD BEEN LET OFF NUMEROUS TIMES, **IT'S JUST WEAPONIZED INCOMPETENCE AND MANIPULATION AT THIS POINT**.

As for me, I don't care if your group decides to shit talk and mock me in your server that has been labeled as "Friendly and Non-toxic" in Disboard, all I want is for my friends
to finally get the consolation they all deserved after going through this hellhole, all I want is to fucking shed some light on this situation now so everyone would be fucking aware at
how problematic your group is and how the "JJBA Corner" is not the same as it used to be, just be glad that the numerous victims from the past didn't gather much evidences because they
were honestly concerned for your group's mental health, but this shit has gone on for way too long now, **FOR YEARS DAMN IT**.

I honestly just want my friends and the victims to finally find the closure they all deserved, it's time to fucking make this shit public.

If you have questions and wants more proof, add me in fucking Discord, my username is summerclove
